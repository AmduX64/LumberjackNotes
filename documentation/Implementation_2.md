## 5. Lessons learned

Over the course of the second release, our team gained knowledge in several different areas of software development.
For many members of the team, it was their first time using AWS Amplify (or any AWS Service for that matter). This
service provided us with valuable experience in back-end development and was imperative for the creation of our log-in
and sign-up features. We found the construction of this especially challenging however, and if we could start over and
select a different back-end service, our team would have used Google FireBase instead of AWS. There were several errors
that we encountered in AWS Amplify that were not included in the documentation, so solving them deemed to be very
challenging since we had nothing to reference. Despite these obstacles, our team was able to work collaboratively to
overcome them. We managed our time much better during our second release and that helped mitigate a crunch before the
deadline.
