## 5. MVP

Our minimum viable product (MVP) will be an application that is initially composed of our four functional requirements,
which will include note-taking, note sharing, ease of use, and customizability. This will allow our application to be in
a state in which the functional requirements can be tested to confirm quality by limited participants within our consumer
segment. We will focus the majority of our efforts at the start on creating a platform that will allow the user to save and
create notes. After which, we will implement the rest of our functional requirements, like customization, and note sharing.
