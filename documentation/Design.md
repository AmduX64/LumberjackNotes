## 1. Description

Lumberjack Notes is a free note-taking application designed to help students and professionals collaborate and share
their notes with their colleagues. Our application aims to provide a user-friendly interface with an intuitive
note-taking environment. Users of Lumberjack Notes will have the ability to customize and modify their workspace to
fit their needs. Users will also have the option to share their notes with fellow students or colleagues.

While Lumberjack Notes is still in early development, the app aims to provide a customizable and user-friendly
interface, as well as an unobtrusive note-taking environment. The user can edit and rearrange the tools in the toolbar
to their liking. These tools can also be utilized while typing so that users note-taking experience is more fluid. The
user will also have easy access to a search function that will allow them to quickly view other notes they have
written. They will also be able to quickly access or modify their profile.
